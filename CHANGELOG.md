## 2025-08-22 - Frontend Consolidation

### Summary
This update consolidates the previously separate `frontend` application into the main `src` directory of the `stack-master-tool` repository. This streamlines the codebase by removing redundancy and improving overall organization. The `simple-backend` remains a separate entity but is now integrated with the consolidated frontend.

### Key Changes
- **Frontend Integration**: The `frontend` directory's contents (specifically `src`) have been moved into `src/frontend` within the main repository.
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies from the old `frontend/package.json` have been merged into the root `package.json`.
- **Configuration Updates**: `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` have been updated to reflect the new file structure and ensure proper path resolution.
- **Route Merging**: The routes defined in the old `frontend/App.jsx` have been integrated into the main `src/App.tsx` file.
- **CSS Fix**: A circular dependency issue in `src/index.css` related to the `.fade-in` utility has been resolved.

### Impact
- **Streamlined Development**: A single frontend codebase simplifies development, maintenance, and deployment.
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate configurations and dependencies.
- **Improved Organization**: All frontend-related code is now under a single, logical structure.

### Future Considerations
- Further refactoring of components and services within `src/frontend` to align with the main application's architecture.
- Potential migration of `simple-backend` into a monorepo structure if further consolidation is desired.
