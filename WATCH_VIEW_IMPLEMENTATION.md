# Watch View Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented the ability to create a watch view on the same computer where you host a meeting, similar to jparty.tv functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Watch Button to Host View

- Added a "Watch View" button to the HostView component
- Button opens a new tab with the watch view for the current meeting
- Works for both manual and remote meetings

### 2. Created Local Watch Hook

- Created `useLocalWatch` hook in `/workspace/src/hooks/useLocalWatch.ts`
- Connects to the same meeting data as the host view
- Provides real-time updates for local meetings
- Handles both manual meetings (code: 'MANUAL') and remote meetings

### 3. Enhanced Watch View Component

- Updated `WatchView.tsx` to support both local and remote meetings
- Auto-detects if it's a local meeting based on meeting code
- Uses appropriate hook (local vs public) based on meeting type
- Shows different UI messages for local vs remote meetings

### 4. Updated Meeting Mode Hook

- Added `useMeetingCode` hook to extract meeting code from URL parameters
- Supports URL-based meeting joining for watch view

## How It Works

### For Local Meetings (Manual Mode)

1. User starts hosting a meeting in manual mode
2. Clicks "Watch View" button in the host interface
3. New tab opens with URL: `/meeting?mode=watch&code=MANUAL`
4. Watch view connects to the same local meeting data
5. Updates in real-time as the host manages the meeting

### For Remote Meetings

1. User starts hosting a meeting and enables remote mode
2. Clicks "Watch View" button in the host interface
3. New tab opens with URL: `/meeting?mode=watch&code=ABC123`
4. Watch view connects to the remote meeting data
5. Updates in real-time via the backend API

## Key Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Watch view updates automatically as the host manages the meeting
- **No Authentication Required**: Watch view works without login
- **Multiple Tabs**: Host can manage multiple watch views simultaneously
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Clear Indicators**: Shows whether it's a local or remote watch view

## Technical Details

### Local Watch Hook

- Uses `useUnifiedFacilitator` to access the same meeting data as the host
- Transforms data to match the expected format for the watch view
- Handles both manual and remote meeting modes

### URL Parameters

- `mode=watch`: Indicates this is a watch view
- `code=MANUAL`: For local/manual meetings
- `code=ABC123`: For remote meetings with specific meeting code

### Error Handling

- Shows appropriate error messages for invalid meeting codes
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Provides fallback UI for loading states

## Usage

1. **Start a Meeting**: Go to the home page and click "Host a Meeting"
2. **Open Watch View**: Click the "Watch View" button in the host interface
3. **Manage Meeting**: Use the host view to manage participants and speaking queue
4. **Observe Changes**: The watch view will update in real-time

This implementation provides the same functionality as jparty.tv where you can create multiple views of the same meeting on the same computer.
