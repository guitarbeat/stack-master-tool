- **Screen Resolution**: 2880 x 1800 (Retina)
- **Network**: Local development environment

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Meeting Creation & Hosting** - HOST mode functionality
2. **Participant Joining** - JOIN mode user experience
3. **Queue Management** - Speaking queue operations
4. **Real-time Synchronization** - Cross-tab functionality
5. **Watch Mode** - Observer experience
6. **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Current System Architecture

- **Visual Feedback**: Save/cancel states with loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user notifications

### 5. Real-time Synchronization

#### ‚úÖ Robust Implementation
- **Cross-tab Functionality**: Changes sync between browser tabs
- **Instant Updates**: Real-time participant additions, queue changes, name edits
- **Reliable State Management**: Consistent state across all connected clients
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and state recovery

### 6. Accessibility & Usability

#### ‚úÖ Strong Foundation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support with logical tab order
- **ARIA Labels**: Comprehensive labeling for screen readers

## Conclusion & Next Steps

The Stack Master Tool demonstrates excellent technical implementation with robust real-time features, accessibility, and user experience design. However, the critical JOIN mode authentication issue prevents users from participating in meetings, rendering the core functionality unusable.

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Supabase RLS policies** for participant creation
2. **Enable WATCH mode meeting joining** by code
3. **Test cross-user functionality** thoroughly

### Long-term Vision:
The platform has strong potential as a democratic meeting facilitation tool with its excellent queue management, real-time synchronization, and accessibility features. Once the authentication issues are resolved, it will provide a superior alternative to traditional meeting facilitation methods.
