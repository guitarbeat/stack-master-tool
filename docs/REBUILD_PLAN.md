# Rebuild Plan

This document outlines the high-level architecture and plan for iterating on the Stack Facilitation App.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: React 18 application built with Vite and TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for rapid UI development.
- **State & Data**: React Query and React Hook Form handle data fetching and form management.
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.io is used for live updates during facilitation sessions.

## Next Steps

1. Audit existing components and remove unused code.
2. Implement automated tests to cover core user flows.
3. Prepare a production-ready build and deployment pipeline.

This plan serves as a starting point and should evolve as the project requirements become clearer.
