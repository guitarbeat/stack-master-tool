## Introduction to Moderation

Moderation in stack facilitation goes beyond just managing disruptive behavior. It's about creating and maintaining an environment where all participants can engage safely and productively in democratic decision-making.

### Goals of Moderation

**Safety**: Ensure all participants feel physically and emotionally safe to participate.

**Inclusion**: Create space for all voices, especially those that are often marginalized.

**Productivity**: Keep discussions focused and moving toward decisions.

**Accountability**: Hold participants responsible for their behavior and commitments.

**Learning**: Help people develop better communication and collaboration skills.

### Moderation vs. Facilitation

While facilitators focus on managing the meeting process and content, moderators focus on managing behavior and maintaining community standards. In many cases, the same person serves both roles, but in larger or more complex meetings, these may be separate functions.

**Facilitator Responsibilities**:
- Managing the speaking queue
- Keeping discussion on topic
- Guiding decision-making processes
- Ensuring all agenda items are covered

**Moderator Responsibilities**:
- Enforcing community guidelines
- Addressing disruptive behavior
- Supporting participants who are struggling
- Maintaining a safe and inclusive environment

### Principles of Effective Moderation

**Proactive**: Address potential problems before they escalate.

**Consistent**: Apply rules and standards fairly to all participants.

**Transparent**: Make decisions openly and explain your reasoning.

**Proportional**: Use the minimum intervention necessary to address problems.

**Restorative**: Focus on repairing harm and rebuilding relationships when possible.

**Trauma-Informed**: Recognize that some participants may have experienced trauma that affects their participation.

## Preventive Moderation

The best moderation is often invisible - creating conditions where problems are less likely to arise in the first place.

### Pre-Meeting Preparation

#### Setting Clear Expectations

**Share Community Guidelines**: Send the Code of Conduct to all participants before the meeting.

**Explain Consequences**: Let people know what happens if guidelines are violated.

**Provide Contact Information**: Give people a way to reach moderators privately if needed.

**Set Technical Expectations**: Explain how to use the platform appropriately.

#### Creating Inclusive Invitations

**Use Inclusive Language**: Avoid assumptions about participants' identities or experiences.

**Provide Accessibility Information**: Let people know about available accommodations.

**Offer Multiple Ways to Participate**: Some people may prefer chat, written input, or other methods.

**Give Adequate Notice**: Allow time for people to prepare and arrange accommodations.

#### Preparing Your Moderation Team

**Assign Clear Roles**: Make sure everyone knows who's responsible for what.

**Review Guidelines Together**: Ensure consistent understanding of standards and procedures.

**Plan for Common Scenarios**: Discuss how you'll handle typical problems.

**Set Up Communication Channels**: Have a way for moderators to communicate privately during the meeting.

### During Meeting Setup

#### Welcoming Participants

**Model Inclusive Behavior**: Use people's correct names and pronouns from the start.

**Acknowledge Different Needs**: Recognize that people may need different accommodations.

**Create Psychological Safety**: Let people know they can participate in ways that feel comfortable.

**Explain the Process**: Help people understand how the meeting will work.

#### Establishing Norms

**Review Community Guidelines**: Briefly remind everyone of behavioral expectations.

**Explain Moderation Process**: Let people know how problems will be addressed.

**Encourage Self-Care**: Remind people they can take breaks or step away if needed.

**Set Communication Norms**: Clarify expectations about muting, chat use, etc.

### Ongoing Preventive Measures

#### Monitoring Participation

**Watch for Patterns**: Notice who's speaking and who isn't.

**Check Energy Levels**: Pay attention to how engaged people seem.

**Observe Interactions**: Look for signs of tension or conflict developing.

**Monitor Chat**: Keep an eye on side conversations and reactions.

#### Maintaining Inclusion

**Encourage Diverse Voices**: Actively invite participation from quiet members.

**Address Microaggressions**: Gently correct subtle forms of bias or exclusion.

**Use Progressive Stack**: Prioritize voices from marginalized communities when appropriate.

**Provide Multiple Participation Options**: Allow people to contribute in different ways.

#### Managing Energy and Flow

**Take Regular Breaks**: Don't let meetings go too long without pauses.

**Vary Activities**: Mix large group discussion with small groups, individual reflection, etc.

**Check In Regularly**: Ask how people are feeling and if they need anything.

**Be Flexible**: Adjust the agenda based on group needs and energy.

## Responsive Moderation

When problems do arise, quick and appropriate response is crucial to maintaining a safe environment.

### Escalation Ladder

Use the minimum intervention necessary to address problems, escalating only when needed:

1. **Gentle Redirect**: Subtle guidance back to appropriate behavior
2. **Private Message**: Direct communication with the individual
3. **Public Reminder**: Clear statement of expectations to the group
4. **Direct Intervention**: Stopping the problematic behavior immediately
5. **Temporary Removal**: Brief timeout from participation
6. **Permanent Removal**: Ending the person's participation in the meeting
7. **Follow-up Actions**: Longer-term consequences or support

### Types of Interventions

#### Gentle Redirects

Use these for minor issues or first-time problems:

**For Off-Topic Comments**:
- "That's an interesting point. How does it relate to our current discussion about the budget?"
- "Let's try to stay focused on the proposal at hand."

**For Time Management**:
- "I want to make sure we hear from everyone, so let's try to keep comments to about 2 minutes."
- "We have several people in the queue, so please wrap up your main point."

**For Process Issues**:
- "Remember to use the speaking queue rather than jumping in directly."
- "Let's let Sarah finish her thought before responding."

#### Private Messages

Use the app's private messaging feature for:
- Addressing behavior that might embarrass someone if corrected publicly
- Checking in with someone who seems upset or withdrawn
- Giving someone a heads-up about potential problems
- Offering support or resources

**Example Private Messages**:
- "Hey, I noticed you've been speaking quite a bit. Could you help make space for others?"
- "Are you doing okay? You seem frustrated. Is there anything I can help with?"
- "I want to give you a heads up that your last comment came across as dismissive. Could you clarify what you meant?"

#### Public Reminders

When problems affect the whole group or when gentle redirects haven't worked:

**For Behavioral Issues**:
- "I want to remind everyone of our agreement to listen respectfully to all speakers."
- "Let's remember that we're here to work together, even when we disagree."

**For Process Issues**:
- "I'm seeing some interruptions. Please use the speaking queue so everyone gets heard."
- "We agreed to keep comments constructive. Let's focus on solutions rather than criticism."

#### Direct Interventions

When immediate action is needed:

**Stopping Harmful Behavior**:
- "I need to stop you there. That language is not acceptable in our community."
- "I'm going to pause the discussion because we're getting into personal attacks."

**Protecting Participants**:
- "I'm not going to allow that kind of comment about [person's] identity."
- "We need to stop this line of discussion because it's becoming harmful."

### De-escalation Techniques

#### Verbal De-escalation

**Lower Your Voice**: Speaking more quietly often encourages others to do the same.

**Acknowledge Emotions**: "I can see this is really important to you."

**Find Common Ground**: "It sounds like we all want what's best for the community."

**Use "I" Statements**: "I'm noticing some tension. Can we take a step back?"

**Ask Questions**: "Help me understand what you're most concerned about."

#### Structural De-escalation

**Change the Format**: Switch from open discussion to small groups or individual reflection.

**Take a Break**: Sometimes people just need a moment to reset.

**Refocus on Process**: "Let's return to our speaking queue and make sure everyone gets heard."

**Separate the Issues**: "It sounds like we have two different concerns here. Let's address them one at a time."

#### Emotional De-escalation

**Validate Feelings**: "I can see this is really affecting you."

**Offer Support**: "Would it be helpful to take a short break?"

**Normalize Emotions**: "It's okay to have strong feelings about this topic."

**Provide Options**: "You can step away if you need to, or we can talk privately."

**Private Contact**: Reach out directly to offer support.

**Professional Resources**: Provide information about mental health services.

**Follow Up**: Check in after the meeting to ensure they're getting help.

**Don't Diagnose**: You're not a mental health professional - focus on immediate safety and connecting to resources.

#### Example Language

- "I'm concerned about you. Can we talk privately?"
- "It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time. Are you safe right now?"
- "I have some resources that might be helpful. Can I share them with you?"

### Conflict Between Participants

#### De-escalation Steps

1. **Interrupt the Conflict**: "I'm going to pause this discussion."
2. **Separate the Issues**: "It sounds like there are two different concerns here."
3. **Refocus on Process**: "Let's use our speaking queue to make sure both perspectives are heard."
4. **Find Common Ground**: "What do you both agree on?"
5. **Move Forward**: "How can we work together on this?"

#### When to Intervene

**Personal Attacks**: Stop immediately when discussion becomes about the people rather than the issues.

**Escalating Emotions**: Intervene before people say things they'll regret.
