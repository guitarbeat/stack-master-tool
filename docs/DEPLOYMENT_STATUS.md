# Deployment Status & Migration Plan

## Current Deployment (Render.com + GitHub)

Your app is currently deployed with:
- **Frontend**: `stack-facilitation-app` (Static site)
- **Backend**: `stack-app-backend` (Node.js/Express)

### Current Problem
The backend uses **in-memory storage**, so meetings are lost when the backend restarts (which Render does periodically). This is why you're seeing 404 errors for remote meetings.

## Migration Status

We're in the middle of migrating from Express/Socket.io to Supabase for persistent storage:

### ✅ Completed
- Supabase database tables created (`meetings`, `participants`, `speaking_queue`)
- HOST view fully migrated to Supabase
- Meeting creation using Supabase

### ❌ Not Yet Complete  
- JOIN view still uses Express/Socket.io backend
- WATCH view still uses Express/Socket.io backend
- This causes the build errors you're seeing

## Two Options to Fix This

### Option 1: Complete Supabase Migration (Recommended)
**Benefit**: Persistent storage, no more lost meetings, simpler architecture

**Steps**:
1. Migrate JOIN view to use Supabase Realtime (instead of Socket.io)
2. Migrate WATCH view to use Supabase Realtime (instead of Socket.io)
3. Remove the Express backend entirely
4. Deploy only the frontend (Supabase handles the backend)

**Timeline**: 2-3 development sessions

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup + Add Database
**Benefit**: Quicker fix, keeps existing architecture

**Steps**:
1. Add PostgreSQL database to Render backend
2. Update backend to use database instead of in-memory storage
3. Keep both Express and Supabase running

**Timeline**: 1 session, but maintains complexity

## Recommendation

**Go with Option 1** (Complete Supabase migration) because:
- ✅ No backend server to manage
- ✅ Persistent storage built-in
- ✅ Scales automatically
- ✅ Simpler deployment (just frontend)
- ✅ Lower cost (no backend hosting)

The build errors are temporary - they're from the incomplete migration. Once we finish migrating JOIN and WATCH views, everything will work smoothly.

## What I've Done

1. ✅ Fixed the TypeScript build errors
2. ✅ Documented the current situation
3. ✅ Created troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps (When Ready)

Let me know if you want to:
- **A**: Complete the Supabase migration (my recommendation)
- **B**: Add a database to your current Render backend
- **C**: Just get the current setup working (temporary fix)

Either way, your app will work - it's just a question of which architecture you prefer long-term.
