# Remote Meeting Connection Issues - Summary

## Problem
Users experiencing "not found" and 404 errors when trying to connect to remote meetings.

## Root Cause
The application requires the backend Express.js server to be running for remote meeting functionality. The backend uses in-memory storage, so meetings are lost when the server restarts.

## Solution
1. **Start Backend Server**: Run `cd backend && npm run dev` to start the server
2. **Create New Meetings**: After backend restarts, create new meetings (old codes won't work)
3. **Long-term**: Complete migration to Supabase Edge Functions for persistence

## Updated Documentation
- ✅ TODO.md - Added critical remote meeting issue
- ✅ PLAN.md - Updated with backend requirement details  
- ✅ Created REMOTE_MEETING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps
1. Complete JOIN view migration to Supabase
2. Complete WATCH view migration to Supabase
3. Remove legacy backend after migration
4. Deploy to production with persistent storage
