# Speaking Distribution Analytics

This document describes the speaking distribution analytics feature that tracks and visualizes speaking time in meetings.

## Overview

The speaking distribution feature provides real-time analytics showing how speaking time is distributed among meeting participants. This helps facilitators ensure balanced participation and identify patterns in who is speaking.

## Features

### Pie Chart Visualization

- **Interactive Chart**: Click on segments to see detailed information
- **Color-coded Segments**: Each participant gets a unique color
- **Percentage Display**: Shows both time and percentage for each participant
- **Real-time Updates**: Chart updates automatically as participants speak

### Speaking Time Tracking

- **Automatic Tracking**: Speaking time is tracked automatically when participants are called to speak
- **Timer Integration**: Works with the built-in speaker timer system
- **Pause/Resume Support**: Timer can be paused and resumed, with speaking time calculated accordingly
- **Accurate Timing**: Tracks actual speaking time, not just time in the speaking position

### Meeting Type Support

- **Local Meetings**: Full support for manual/local meetings with real-time tracking
- **Remote Meetings**: Works with remote meetings using the same analytics system
- **Watch Views**: Local meeting watch views display speaking distribution data
- **Consistent Interface**: Same analytics interface across all meeting types

### Direct Response Handling

- **Include/Exclude Toggle**: Option to include or exclude direct responses in analytics
- **Separate Tracking**: Direct responses can be tracked separately from regular speaking time
- **Flexible Analysis**: Allows different perspectives on participation patterns

## How It Works

### Data Collection

1. **Speaker Timer**: When a participant is called to speak, a timer starts automatically
2. **Time Tracking**: The system tracks how long each person speaks
3. **Segment Recording**: When a speaker finishes, their speaking time is recorded
4. **Real-time Updates**: The distribution chart updates immediately

### Data Processing

1. **Aggregation**: Speaking time is aggregated by participant
2. **Calculation**: Percentages are calculated based on total speaking time
3. **Sorting**: Participants are sorted by speaking time (highest first)
4. **Formatting**: Time is displayed in seconds for the chart

### Visualization

1. **Chart Generation**: A pie chart is generated with participant data
2. **Color Assignment**: Each participant gets a unique color from a predefined palette
3. **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips and legends provide additional information
4. **Responsive Design**: Chart adapts to different screen sizes

## User Interface

### Chart Display

- **Expandable Card**: Chart is contained in an expandable card component
- **Title and Description**: Clear labeling of the analytics feature
- **Toggle Button**: Button to include/exclude direct responses
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Chart Controls

- **Include Direct Responses**: Toggle to include or exclude direct response time
- **Real-time Updates**: Chart updates automatically without manual refresh
- **Interactive Legend**: Click legend items to highlight chart segments
- **Tooltip Information**: Hover over segments for detailed information

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

- **SpeakingDistribution.tsx**: Main chart component
- **Chart Integration**: Uses Recharts library for visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness

### Data Management

- **useSpeakingHistory Hook**: Manages speaking time data
- **useSpeakerTimer Hook**: Handles timer functionality
- **useUnifiedFacilitator Hook**: Integrates analytics with meeting management

### State Management

- **Speaking Segments**: Array of speaking time records
- **Real-time Updates**: State updates trigger chart re-renders
- **Persistent Data**: Speaking history persists during the meeting

## Use Cases

### Facilitation

- **Monitor Participation**: Track who is speaking and for how long
- **Identify Patterns**: Notice if certain participants dominate or are quiet
- **Encourage Balance**: Use data to encourage more balanced participation
- **Share Insights**: Show the group participation patterns

### Meeting Analysis

- **Post-meeting Review**: Analyze participation patterns after meetings
- **Process Improvement**: Use data to improve meeting facilitation
- **Participation Trends**: Track changes in participation over time
- **Meeting Effectiveness**: Assess if meetings are achieving balanced participation

### Training and Development

- **Facilitator Training**: Use analytics to train new facilitators
- **Best Practices**: Develop guidelines based on participation data
- **Process Refinement**: Improve meeting processes using data insights

## Best Practices

### For Facilitators

- **Use as a Tool**: Analytics should inform facilitation, not dictate it
- **Consider Context**: Some people may need to speak more due to their role
- **Respect Differences**: People communicate differently - some through listening
- **Focus on Inclusion**: Use data to ensure everyone has opportunities to participate

### For Participants

- **Awareness**: Being aware of participation patterns can help improve meetings
- **Self-reflection**: Use data to reflect on your own participation
- **Support Others**: Help create space for quieter voices to be heard
- **Balance**: Strive for balanced participation while respecting individual differences

### For Organizations

- **Process Improvement**: Use analytics to improve meeting processes
- **Training**: Include participation awareness in facilitator training
- **Culture Building**: Foster a culture of balanced participation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and improve meeting practices

## Privacy and Ethics

### Data Handling

- **Meeting Scope**: Speaking data is only collected during active meetings
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data is not stored permanently after meetings
- **Consent**: Participants are aware that speaking time is being tracked
- **Transparency**: The feature is clearly visible and explained to participants

### Ethical Considerations

- **Inclusion Focus**: Use data to promote inclusion, not to enforce rigid rules
- **Respect Privacy**: Be thoughtful about when and how to share participation data
- **Avoid Shaming**: Never use data to shame or embarrass participants
- **Supportive Environment**: Create an environment where everyone feels comfortable participating

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chart Not Updating**: Check if the speaker timer is running and participants are being tracked properly.

**Missing Data**: Ensure that speaking segments are being recorded when participants finish speaking.

**Display Issues**: Verify that the chart component is properly mounted and receiving data.

**Timer Problems**: Check that the speaker timer is working correctly and recording time accurately.
