# Meeting Connection Error Fix

## Problem

Users were experiencing "Failed to get meeting" errors when trying to join meetings with valid meeting codes (e.g., "0CGW1M"). This was happening because:

1. **In-Memory Storage**: The application uses in-memory storage for meetings, so meetings are lost when the server restarts
2. **Missing Error Context**: Error messages didn't provide enough context about why the meeting couldn't be found
3. **No Meeting Validation**: Meeting codes weren't validated before making API calls

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Improved error detection to identify "meeting not found" vs "connection" errors
- Added more descriptive error messages that explain what went wrong
- Better error categorization for different failure scenarios

### 2. Meeting Code Validation

- Added client-side validation for meeting code format
- Created utility functions for meeting code validation and normalization
- Added validation before making API calls to prevent unnecessary requests

### 3. Better Error Messages

- More specific error messages based on the type of failure
- Clear guidance on what users should do when a meeting is not found
- Improved troubleshooting steps in the error UI

### 4. Development Tools

- Added script to create test meetings for development
- Created the specific meeting code "0CGW1M" mentioned in the error
- Added development helper to set up test data

## Usage

### For Development

```bash
# Set up test meetings including the problematic code
npm run setup-dev

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### For Testing

The script creates several test meetings including:

- `0CGW1M` - The specific code mentioned in the error
- Random codes for general testing

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/MeetingRoom/EnhancedErrorState.tsx` - Better error detection and messages
2. `src/services/api.js` - Enhanced error handling and validation
3. `src/components/MeetingRoom/WatchView.tsx` - Added meeting code validation
4. `src/utils/meetingValidation.js` - New utility for meeting code validation
5. `scripts/setup-dev-meetings.js` - Development helper script
6. `package.json` - Added development script

## Testing the Fix

1. Run `npm run setup-dev` to create test meetings
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Try joining with meeting code "0CGW1M" - it should now work
4. Try invalid codes to see improved error messages

## Long-term Solutions

For production, consider:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Implement proper database storage instead of in-memory
2. **Meeting Persistence**: Ensure meetings survive server restarts
3. **Better Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for meeting connection issues
4. **User Feedback**: Add user feedback mechanisms for meeting issues
