## Introduction to Stack Facilitation

Stack facilitation is a democratic meeting process that ensures all voices are heard while maintaining productive discussion. The "stack" refers to the speaking queue, where participants line up to share their thoughts in an organized, transparent manner.

### Core Principles

**Inclusion**: Everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and be heard.

**Transparency**: The speaking order and reasoning are visible to all participants.

**Efficiency**: Structured discussion that respects everyone's time.

**Democracy**: Decisions are made collectively with input from all stakeholders.

**Safety**: A respectful environment where people feel comfortable sharing.

### Benefits of Stack Facilitation

- **Prevents Interruptions**: Speakers can complete their thoughts without being cut off
- **Reduces Dominance**: Prevents a few voices from controlling the conversation
- **Increases Participation**: Encourages quieter members to contribute
- **Maintains Focus**: Keeps discussion on topic and moving forward
- **Creates Equity**: Progressive stack can prioritize underrepresented voices
- **Builds Community**: Develops listening skills and mutual respect

### When to Use Stack Facilitation

Stack facilitation works well for:
- **Large Group Discussions** (10+ people)
- **Contentious Topics** where emotions may run high
- **Decision-Making Meetings** requiring input from all stakeholders
- **Diverse Groups** with varying communication styles
- **Virtual Meetings** where managing speaking turns is challenging
- **Democratic Organizations** committed to inclusive processes

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

   - **Pronouns**: Optional but recommended for inclusive environment

3. **Configure Meeting Settings**:
   - **Progressive Stack**: Enable if you want to prioritize underrepresented voices
   - **Invite Tags**: Set up identity categories for progressive stack (e.g., "new_member", "directly_affected", "marginalized_identity")
   - **Time Limits**: Set speaking time per person (typically 2-3 minutes)
   - **Queue Limits**: Maximum number of people in queue at once
   - **Direct Response Settings**: Time window and limits for responses

4. **Privacy and Safety Settings**:
   - **Allow Anonymous Participants**: Decide if people can join without identifying themselves
   - **Recording Permissions**: Set whether the meeting will be recorded
   - **Data Retention**: Configure how long meeting data is kept
   - **Incident Reporting**: Ensure reporting system is enabled

5. **Generate Meeting PIN**: Share the 6-character code with participants

### Welcoming Participants

**Start with Introductions**: Have people share names, pronouns, and brief check-ins.

**Explain the Process**: Give a quick overview of how stack facilitation works.

**Review the Agenda**: Confirm timing and priorities with the group.

**Establish Norms**: Remind everyone of community guidelines and expectations.

**Address Technical Issues**: Help anyone having trouble with the platform.

### Setting the Tone

**Model Inclusive Behavior**: Use people's correct names and pronouns.

**Encourage Participation**: Let people know their voices are valued.

**Acknowledge Different Styles**: Recognize that people communicate differently.

**Create Safety**: Remind everyone of the Code of Conduct and reporting options.

**Stay Neutral**: Avoid showing favoritism or pushing particular viewpoints.

## Facilitating Discussion

### Opening Discussion on a Topic

1. **Introduce the Topic**: Provide context and background information

2. **Frame the Question**: Be specific about what input you're seeking

3. **Set Time Boundaries**: Let people know how long discussion will last

4. **Invite Initial Speakers**: Ask who would like to share thoughts

5. **Monitor the Queue**: Keep track of who's waiting to speak

### Managing Speaking Flow

**Call Speakers Clearly**: Use names and indicate when it's someone's turn.

**Enforce Time Limits**: Gently remind speakers when time is up.

**Maintain Order**: Ensure people speak in queue order unless there's a point of process.

**Encourage Conciseness**: Ask speakers to focus on key points.

**Bridge Between Speakers**: Summarize or connect different contributions.

### Facilitator Language Techniques

**Use Neutral Language**: Avoid words that show bias or judgment.

**Ask Open Questions**: Encourage exploration rather than yes/no answers.

**Reflect and Summarize**: "What I'm hearing is..." to check understanding.

**Acknowledge Contributions**: Thank speakers and validate their input.

**Redirect Gently**: Guide off-topic comments back to the main discussion.

### Example Facilitator Phrases

**Starting Discussion**:
- "Let's open this topic for discussion. Who would like to share their thoughts?"
- "I see several hands up. Let me add you to the speaking queue."
- "We have about 20 minutes for this topic. Please keep comments to 2-3 minutes."

**Managing the Queue**:
- "Sarah, you're next in the queue, followed by Marcus and then Jennifer."
- "I see you have a direct response, Tom. You'll go next after the current speaker."
- "Point of process from Alex - go ahead."

**Keeping Discussion Focused**:
- "That's an interesting point. How does it relate to the current proposal?"
- "I want to make sure we hear from everyone in the queue before moving on."
- "Let's try to focus on solutions rather than restating the problem."

**Encouraging Participation**:
- "We haven't heard from some folks yet. Anyone else want to share?"
- "I notice the queue is mostly people who've already spoken. New voices?"
- "Remember, you can also use the chat for shorter comments or questions."

## Managing the Speaking Queue

### Understanding Queue Types

**Raise Hand**: General comments, questions, or new points
- Most common type of queue entry
- Follows standard FIFO (first in, first out) order
- Subject to progressive stack prioritization if enabled

**Direct Response**: Immediate response to current speaker
- Time-limited (usually 30-60 seconds)
- Goes to front of queue
- Limited number per person to prevent dominance

**Point of Process**: Questions about meeting procedure
- Highest priority - interrupts current flow
- Used for clarification about how the meeting is being run
- Should be brief and focused on process, not content

**Point of Information**: Factual information relevant to discussion
- High priority, goes near front of queue
- Should be objective facts, not opinions
- Helps inform the discussion with missing information

**Point of Clarification**: Request for speaker to clarify their statement
- Moderate priority
- Used when something wasn't clear or audible
- Should be specific about what needs clarification

### Queue Management Best Practices

**Monitor Queue Length**: Don't let it get too long (5-7 people maximum).

**Balance Participation**: Watch for patterns of who's speaking and who isn't.

**Manage Time**: Keep track of how long discussion has been going.

**Address Queue Types**: Make sure people understand when to use different types.

**Handle Duplicates**: If multiple people make the same point, acknowledge and move on.

### Dealing with Queue Issues

**Long Queue**: 
- Pause adding new speakers
- Ask for brief comments only
- Consider breaking into small groups

**Empty Queue**:
- Ask specific questions to generate discussion
- Call on quiet participants directly (with permission)
- Move to next agenda item if discussion is complete

**Inappropriate Queue Use**:
- Gently correct misuse of direct response or points
- Remind people of the purpose of different queue types
- Move items to appropriate queue position if needed

**Technical Problems**:
- Help people join the queue manually if needed
- Use backup methods (chat, verbal) if the app fails
- Keep a written backup of the speaking order

## Progressive Stack Implementation

### Understanding Progressive Stack

Progressive stack is a method of prioritizing speakers to ensure that voices from marginalized or underrepresented groups are heard first. It's based on the principle that in most discussions, certain people (often those with more privilege or confidence) tend to speak more, while others may be hesitant to participate.

### When to Use Progressive Stack

**Diverse Groups**: When your meeting includes people from different backgrounds, identities, or power levels.

**Sensitive Topics**: Discussions about equity, inclusion, or issues that affect different groups differently.

**Decision-Making**: When making decisions that will impact various constituencies.

**Large Meetings**: In bigger groups where it's harder for everyone to be heard.

**Historical Imbalances**: When certain voices have been marginalized in past discussions.

### Setting Up Progressive Stack

1. **Enable in Meeting Settings**: Turn on progressive stack when creating the meeting

2. **Define Invite Tags**: Set up categories that are relevant to your group:
   - **Identity-based**: "person_of_color", "lgbtq", "woman", "non_binary"
   - **Experience-based**: "new_member", "directly_affected", "frontline_worker"
   - **Role-based**: "community_member", "volunteer", "under_30"

3. **Explain to Participants**: Make sure everyone understands how it works

4. **Voluntary Self-Identification**: Let people choose their own tags - never assign them

### How Progressive Stack Prioritization Works

The app uses a multi-tier priority system:

**Tier 1 (Highest Priority)**: People with invite tags who haven't spoken recently
**Tier 2 (High Priority)**: People with invite tags who have spoken recently  
**Tier 3 (Medium Priority)**: People without invite tags who haven't spoken recently
**Tier 4 (Lower Priority)**: People without invite tags who have spoken recently

Within each tier, the order is first-come, first-served (FIFO).

### Facilitating with Progressive Stack

**Explain the System**: "We're using progressive stack to make sure we hear from people who are most affected by this issue first."

**Encourage Self-Identification**: "When you join the queue, you can select any tags that apply to you. This is completely voluntary and helps us prioritize voices."

**Be Transparent**: "The app shows why each person is in their queue position, so everyone can see how the prioritization works."

**Address Questions**: Be prepared to explain why progressive stack is being used and how it benefits the group.

**Monitor Effectiveness**: Pay attention to whether it's actually improving participation from underrepresented voices.

### Common Concerns and Responses

**"This isn't fair - it should be first come, first served"**
- Response: "Progressive stack helps balance out advantages that some people have in speaking up. The goal is to make sure everyone gets heard, not just the people who are quickest to raise their hands."

**"I don't want to identify myself with tags"**
- Response: "That's completely fine. The tags are voluntary, and you can participate without using any. The system will still work fairly."

**"How do we know people are being honest about their identities?"**
- Response: "We trust people to self-identify honestly. The system is based on good faith participation, just like the rest of our meeting process."

**"This feels divisive or like it's creating categories"**
- Response: "The categories already exist in society - we're just acknowledging them to make sure everyone gets heard. The goal is inclusion, not division."

### Best Practices for Progressive Stack

**Start with Education**: Help people understand the purpose and benefits.

**Make it Optional**: Never require people to use identity tags.

**Be Flexible**: Adjust the system based on your group's needs and feedback.

**Combine with Other Techniques**: Use alongside small group discussions, written input, etc.

**Evaluate Effectiveness**: Regularly assess whether it's improving participation.

**Respect Privacy**: Don't pressure people to share more about their identities than they're comfortable with.

## Proposal and Decision Making

### Introduction to Consent-Based Decision Making

The Stack Facilitation App uses consent-based decision making, which is different from both majority vote and full consensus. The goal is to find decisions that everyone can live with, even if they're not everyone's first choice.

### The Four Levels of Consent

**Agree**: "I support this proposal and think it's a good idea."

**Stand Aside**: "I don't love this proposal, but I can live with it and won't block the group from moving forward."

**Concern**: "I have significant reservations about this proposal that need to be addressed before I can consent."

**Block**: "I believe this proposal would cause serious harm to the group or goes against our fundamental values. I cannot consent to it."

### The Proposal Process

#### 1. Proposal Creation

**Anyone Can Propose**: All participants can create proposals, not just facilitators.

**Clear and Specific**: Proposals should be concrete and actionable.

**Provide Context**: Include background information and rationale.

**Consider Impact**: Think about who will be affected and how.

#### 2. Discussion Phase

**Open for Input**: Allow time for questions, concerns, and suggestions.

**Use the Speaking Queue**: Manage discussion through the normal stack process.

**Encourage Questions**: Make sure people understand what they're being asked to consent to.

**Allow for Amendments**: Be open to modifying the proposal based on feedback.

#### 3. Checking for Consent

**Call for Initial Responses**: Ask people to indicate their level of consent.

**Address Concerns**: Work with people who have concerns to see if the proposal can be modified.

**Respect Blocks**: Take blocks seriously and explore whether the proposal should be withdrawn or significantly changed.

**Seek Creative Solutions**: Look for ways to address objections while maintaining the proposal's intent.

#### 4. Final Decision

**Document the Decision**: Record what was decided and any conditions or amendments.

**Assign Next Steps**: Make sure someone is responsible for implementation.

**Set Review Points**: Plan when to check back on how the decision is working.

### Facilitating Proposal Discussions

**Stay Neutral**: Don't advocate for or against proposals, even if you have opinions.

**Ask Clarifying Questions**: Help the group understand exactly what's being proposed.

**Manage Time**: Balance thorough discussion with meeting efficiency.

**Encourage Participation**: Make sure all voices are heard, especially those most affected.

**Look for Common Ground**: Help identify areas of agreement and shared values.

### Working with Different Consent Levels

#### Handling Concerns

**Take Them Seriously**: Don't dismiss or minimize people's concerns.

**Ask for Specifics**: "What specifically concerns you about this proposal?"

**Explore Solutions**: "What would need to change for you to be able to consent?"

**Consider Amendments**: Work with the proposer to modify the proposal.

**Allow Time**: Don't rush people to change their consent level.

#### Addressing Blocks

**Understand the Objection**: "Can you help us understand why you believe this would cause harm?"

**Explore Alternatives**: "Is there a different approach that would meet the same need?"

**Consider Withdrawal**: Sometimes the right response to a block is to withdraw the proposal.

**Respect the Process**: Blocks are a legitimate part of consent-based decision making.

**Don't Pressure**: Never try to convince someone to remove a block through pressure or guilt.

### Example Facilitation Language for Proposals

**Introducing a Proposal**:
- "We have a proposal from Maria about changing our meeting schedule. Maria, would you like to present it?"
- "Let's take some time to discuss this proposal. I'll open the speaking queue for questions and comments."

**Checking for Consent**:
- "Let's see where everyone stands on this proposal. Please indicate your consent level in the app."
- "I see we have mostly agrees and stand-asides, but Jennifer has indicated a concern. Jennifer, can you share what's worrying you?"

**Working with Concerns**:
- "Thank you for sharing that concern. Does anyone have ideas for how we might address it?"
- "Maria, as the proposer, how do you feel about modifying the proposal to address Jennifer's concern?"

**Handling Blocks**:
- "David has indicated a block. David, can you help us understand your objection?"
- "This seems like a fundamental disagreement about our values. Should we table this proposal and have a broader discussion about our principles?"

### Decision Documentation

**Record All Decisions**: Use the app's export function to create meeting minutes.

**Include Dissent**: Note any concerns or stand-asides, not just the final decision.

**Assign Responsibility**: Make sure someone is accountable for implementation.

**Set Timelines**: Include deadlines and review dates.

**Share Widely**: Make sure all stakeholders know about decisions that affect them.

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Common Challenges

#### Disruptive Participants

**Symptoms**: Interrupting others, making personal attacks, going off-topic repeatedly, dominating discussion.

**Strategies**:
- **Address Privately First**: Use private chat or breakout to speak with them directly
- **Restate Norms**: Remind the group of agreed-upon meeting guidelines
- **Use Structure**: Enforce speaking queue and time limits more strictly
- **Take Breaks**: Sometimes a short break can reset the energy
- **Remove if Necessary**: As a last resort, use the app's removal features

**Example Language**:
- "Let's remember our agreement to let each person finish their thoughts before responding."
- "I need to interrupt here. We agreed to keep comments to 3 minutes, and we need to move to the next speaker."
- "I'm going to ask everyone to take a deep breath and remember our community guidelines."

#### Emotional Outbursts

**Symptoms**: Crying, anger, personal attacks, shutting down.

**Strategies**:
- **Stay Calm**: Model the behavior you want to see
- **Acknowledge Feelings**: "I can see this is really important to you"
- **Offer Support**: "Would you like to take a short break?"
- **Redirect to Process**: "Let's use our speaking queue to make sure everyone gets heard"
- **Follow Up Privately**: Check in with the person after the meeting

**Example Language**:
- "I can see there are strong feelings about this topic. Let's take a moment to breathe."
- "Thank you for sharing how this affects you. Let's make sure we hear from others too."
- "Would it be helpful to take a 5-minute break?"

## Advanced Facilitation Techniques

### Working with Large Groups (50+ People)

**Use Breakout Discussions**: Divide into smaller groups for initial discussion, then report back.

**Implement Stricter Time Limits**: Keep individual comments shorter to allow more voices.

**Use Multiple Facilitators**: Have co-facilitators to help manage the queue and process.

**Consider Asynchronous Input**: Allow people to submit comments in writing before or during the meeting.

**Focus on Key Decisions**: Don't try to discuss every detail in the large group.

### Facilitating Contentious Topics

**Set Extra Clear Norms**: Be explicit about expectations for respectful dialogue.

**Use Structured Formats**: Consider fishbowl discussions or other formats that create more structure.

**Plan for Emotions**: Expect strong feelings and have strategies ready.

**Focus on Interests, Not Positions**: Help people share what they need rather than just what they want.

**Take More Breaks**: Allow time for people to process and reset.

### Multi-Meeting Processes

**Create Consistent Structure**: Use similar processes across meetings so people know what to expect.

**Track Participation Over Time**: Make sure the same voices aren't always dominating.

**Build on Previous Discussions**: Reference earlier conversations and decisions.

**Plan Meeting Sequences**: Think about how meetings build toward larger goals.

**Maintain Momentum**: Keep people engaged between meetings with updates and preparation.

### Hybrid (In-Person and Virtual) Meetings

**Ensure Equal Participation**: Make sure virtual participants aren't disadvantaged.

**Manage Technology Carefully**: Test all systems before the meeting starts.

**Use Multiple Communication Channels**: Combine video, audio, chat, and the stack app.

**Rotate Attention**: Make sure to engage both in-person and virtual participants.

**Plan for Technical Difficulties**: Have backup plans for when technology fails.

### Cultural Considerations

**Understand Communication Styles**: Recognize that people from different cultures may communicate differently.

**Be Flexible with Process**: Adapt the stack system to work for your specific community.

**Address Language Barriers**: Provide interpretation or allow extra time for non-native speakers.

**Respect Different Decision-Making Traditions**: Acknowledge that not all cultures use the same consensus processes.

**Learn from Your Community**: Ask participants what works best for them.

### Facilitating Trauma-Informed Meetings

**Create Safety First**: Make sure people feel physically and emotionally safe.

**Offer Choice and Control**: Let people decide how much to participate.

**Be Transparent**: Explain processes clearly so people know what to expect.

**Recognize Triggers**: Be aware that certain topics or processes might be difficult for some people.

**Provide Support Resources**: Have information available about counseling or other support services.

### Building Facilitation Teams

**Develop Multiple Facilitators**: Don't rely on just one person to run all meetings.

**Create Clear Roles**: Define who does what (facilitator, stack keeper, note taker, etc.).

**Practice Together**: Run practice sessions to build skills and coordination.

**Debrief After Meetings**: Talk about what worked and what could be improved.

**Support Each Other**: Facilitation can be emotionally demanding - take care of your team.

### Measuring Success

**Track Participation**: Monitor who speaks and how often over time.

**Survey Participants**: Regularly ask for feedback on the process.

**Measure Decision Quality**: Assess whether decisions made in meetings are good ones.

**Monitor Implementation**: See how well decisions are actually carried out.

**Assess Group Health**: Look at overall group dynamics and satisfaction.

---

This guide is a living document that should be updated based on experience and feedback. The most important thing to remember is that facilitation is both an art and a skill that improves with practice. Be patient with yourself and your group as you learn to use these tools effectively.

**Remember**: The goal is not perfect meetings, but meetings that serve your community's needs for democratic participation and collective decision-making.
