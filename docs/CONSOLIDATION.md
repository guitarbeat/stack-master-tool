# Consolidation Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

The repository currently contains two distinct frontend applications:

1.  **Root-level Frontend (`./src`)**: This application uses React with Vite, Shadcn UI, and TypeScript. It appears to be the more feature-rich and actively developed frontend, judging by the number of dependencies and components.
2.  **`frontend/` Directory Frontend**: This is another React application, also using Vite, but with a simpler setup (less dependencies, no Shadcn UI). It seems to be an older or simpler version of the frontend, possibly for a specific 


purpose (e.g., a simple facilitation app as indicated by its `package.json` name `stack-facilitation-simple`).

There is also a `simple-backend` directory, which is a Node.js application using Express and Socket.io.

## Redundancies and Opportunities

-   **Duplicate Frontend Implementations**: The most significant redundancy is the presence of two separate frontend applications. The root-level frontend seems to be the primary one, and the `frontend/` directory likely contains an older or less complete version. Consolidating these into a single, unified frontend is crucial.
-   **Shared UI Components**: Both frontends might have similar UI components or functionalities that can be abstracted into a shared library or a single component system.
-   **Backend Integration**: The `simple-backend` serves as the API for the frontend. Its integration needs to be seamless with the consolidated frontend.

## Proposed Consolidated Structure

The goal is to have a single, unified frontend application and a clear separation between frontend and backend.

## Consolidation Steps

1.  **Migrate `frontend/` content**: Carefully review the `frontend/` directory. Identify any unique features, components, or logic that are not present in the root-level `src/` frontend. Migrate these necessary parts into the `src/` directory, adapting them to the existing structure and technologies (e.g., TypeScript, Shadcn UI).
2.  **Remove `frontend/` directory**: Once all necessary components and logic are migrated, delete the `frontend/` directory.
3.  **Rename `simple-backend`**: Rename the `simple-backend` directory to `backend` for clarity and consistency.
4.  **Update References**: Ensure all internal references (imports, file paths) are updated to reflect the new consolidated structure.
5.  **Review `package.json` files**: Consolidate dependencies where possible. The root `package.json` should contain all necessary dependencies for the unified frontend. The `backend/package.json` will remain for the backend dependencies.
6.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test the application to ensure all functionalities are working as expected after consolidation.
7.  **Documentation**: Update `README.md` and any other relevant documentation to reflect the new repository structure and architectural decisions.
